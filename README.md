After a period in the Oil and Gas industry as a mechanical engineer, I transitioned into the field of data science. Throughout my engineering career, I pursued additional studies in Python and data analysis, particularly focusing on libraries like Pandas and TensorFlow. Furthermore, I delved into the development of an embedded system for data acquisition consisting in a microelectromechanical vibration sensor and a current transformer, both controlled by a SoC (System on a Chip). My project involved capturing data from the sensor mounted on an induction motor, transmitting it to the cloud for storage, data preprocessing, and ultimately using it in statistical models such as linear regression and support vector machine to predict failure in the motor. This work led to a published article : Failure Identifier for 3-Phase Induction Motor Based on Support Vector Machines Via Cloud.
